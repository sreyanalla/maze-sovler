Maze following strategy

	- move ir sensor to the right of the robot**
	- if the robot reaches an intersection and it can't turn right (aka the ir sensor 	is activated) then the robot goes straight
	- if when the robot moves forward, then hits a wall
	  --go back and turn around 180*
	  --when it sees the intersection again, turn right

	still confused with stacking methods and finishing the maze idea
