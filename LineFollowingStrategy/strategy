start of maze:
	initialize sensors like before
	pilot.forward();
		with the methods for line following, touch, and ir implemented
		these must be implemented together in order to complete the maze
		each sequence stored in memory (stack) but only if that sequence is on the correct path that leads to solving the maze
		
question:
when attempting to find whether it is a dead end, do we have the robot go right first then left or vice versa?
	look at the pathway of the line and determine whether it would be more advantageous to turn left first or right
	
every sequence (wall/turn to wall/turn) is stored in the stack
if that sequence contains a dead end (wall to wall)
	remove that sequence from the stack
	
when the robot detects a wall using IR or touch (leaning towards IR)
	turn one direction and move forward in order to detect whether there is a wall on that side
		if there is a wall
			then do this for the other side
		if both are walls, it is established that the robot is at a dead end
			that sequence is removed from the stack
			
end of maze:
robot stops (and stops adding to the stack) when the robot senses that it is above the tin voil
	we need to add in the color of the tin foil to our color sensor
then the robot goes back through the maze according to the stack
	this should be without errors like dead ends
